## Arcadia
Scaling a garden can be tough. It's hard to manage many different plants and their differing wants and needs to help them thrive.
_Arcadia_ is a garden managing solution that allows users to monitor and interface with their plants in a dashboard-like manner.
Users can set watering frequencies for each plant and be notified when a plant needs watering. Integrations with various APIs could
also provide users with interesting facts on the many plants occupying their garden.
