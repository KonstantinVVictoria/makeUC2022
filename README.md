Scaling a garden can be tricky. Many crops tend to thrive under conditions unique to them; some may require certain soil nutrients, or to be watered more or less frequently than others. Arcata is a garden management solution that provides a minimal interface for managing your plants. By integrating with 3rd party APIs, Arcata provides users with neat facts on the plants in their garden, and bundles them in a clean visualization so users can show off their gardens.
